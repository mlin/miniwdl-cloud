miniwdl swarm nodes use this shared directory as a custom coordination bus.
* /mnt/shared/.swarm/manager has the internal address of the swarm manager endpoint
* /mnt/shared/.swarm/workers/{worker_hostname} for each worker machine, containing files:
  - alive: touched (mtime updated) every minute while the worker is alive
  - in-swarm: touched every minute while the worker is properly attached to the swarm
  - running-containers: touched every minute while the worker has >=1 running Docker containers
  The state of the worker fleet can thus be inferred from these files' mtimes.
