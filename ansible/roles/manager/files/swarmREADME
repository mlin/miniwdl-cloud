miniwdl swarm nodes use this shared directory as a custom monitoring & signaling bus.
/mnt/shared/.swarm/workers/{hostname} for each worker node, contains files:
  - boot: touched (mtime updated) when the worker boots up
  - alive: touched every minute while the worker is up
  - in-swarm: touched every minute while the worker is attached to the swarm
  - running-containers: touched every minute while the worker has >=1 running Docker containers
The state of the worker fleet can thus be inferred from these files' mtimes.
